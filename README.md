# Discord Webhook Spammer

This is my first project it is a simple  discord webhook spammer  that sends repeated messages to a discord webhook .

## Requirements

Before running the project, you'll need to install the following Python packages(pretty sure python comes with time): 

- `requests`
- `time`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests time
