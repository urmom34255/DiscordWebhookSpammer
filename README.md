# Webhook Spammer

This is my first project! It is a simple webhook spammer script that sends repeated requests to a specified webhook URL.

## Requirements

Before running the project, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

- `requests`
- `time`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests time
